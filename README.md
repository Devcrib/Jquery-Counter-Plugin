# Dean-Jquery-Counter-Plugin
A Jquery plugin for creating an html element that counts from 0 to your desired number within a div element in the form of an h4 tag.

there a two speed levels, decent and super-fast.


<h1>How-To</h1> <br>
add the class 'decent' or 'super-fast' to your div element.

add 'data-number' to the div element and input the value into quotes like so: data-number = "90";

add 'data-format' to the div element and give it a value of either 'percentage' or 'plain'.
percentage means there will be a "%" sign next to the value and plain means there wont be any sign.

add an empty h4 tag like so: ```<h4></h4>```
please feel free to use and improve.

e.g ```<div class="decent" data-number = "90" data-format = "percentage"><h4></h4></div>```
